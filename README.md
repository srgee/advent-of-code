# 🎄 Advent of Code - My Python Solutions

Welcome! This is where I dump my solutions for the Advent of Code puzzles. I come back here every December to tackle the new challenges, time permitting.

I’m a big fan of AoC for a couple of reasons:

- It's a blast: The puzzles are super clever, and let’s be honest, saving Christmas with code is just fun.

- Staying sharp: It’s my favorite way to keep my Python skills fresh and stay up-to-date with new tricks, libraries, and logic.

I try to keep things organized by year and day, so feel free to poke around!

# 📂 Repo Structure

The folders are sorted by year, making it easy to find what you're looking for:

.
├── 2023/
│   ├── day01/
│   ├── day02/
│   └── ...
├── 2024/
│   ├── day01/
│   └── ...
└── README.md

# 🛠️ Running Solutions

If you want to take any of these for a spin:

```bash
# Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/advent-of-code.git

# Hop into a specific day:
cd 2024/day01

# Run the script:
python solution.py
```

# Creating New Days
Use the automation scriipts to create file structure automagically:
```bash
python scripts/new_day.py 5
```
This creates a the folder hierarchy and python module templates for day 5 in 2025 folder.

# 🙏 Big Thanks

Huge shoutout to the people who make this easier and more fun:

- Eric Wastl (Topaz): For dreaming up Advent of Code and keeping the magic alive every year. You're a legend!

- Trey Hunner: For his awesome automation script. It handles all the modular boilerplate so I can jump straight into the puzzles on Day 1.
